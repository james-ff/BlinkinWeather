See // TODO: comments in codebase for areas work to be done if more time were available

Notes:
- I re-used the APIClient class, and it's surrounding classes, from another codebase that I developed for a similar task
- I ran slightly over the suggested time as I focused (maybe too much, in hindsight) on the Model layer and fetching all available data from the API
- The UI I implemented in SwiftUI, with the extra time I spent, shows some but not as much information as I would have liked; but at least shows a working end-to-end solution
